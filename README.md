# INFO 201 - Coursework Repository

This repository contains my homework, assignments, and projects for **INFO 201 (Foundations of Data Science)** at the University of Washington.

---

## 📂 Structure
Each assignment will have its own folder:
- `PS0/` – Problem Set 0  
- `PS1/` – Problem Set 1  
- `PS2/` – Problem Set 2  
- ...and so on

Inside each folder, you’ll typically find:
- `.Rmd` files (R Markdown submissions)  
- `.html` or `.pdf` files (rendered outputs)  
- Instruction PDFs provided for the assignment  

---

## ⚙️ Tools
- **R / RStudio** for development  
- **R Markdown** for write-ups and submissions  
- **Git + GitHub** for version control  

---

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Do the assignment in RStudio (`.Rmd` file).  
2. Knit to `.html` / `.pdf` for final output.  
3. Commit and push updates:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "PSX submission"
   git push
   ```

---

## 📌 Notes
- A `.gitignore` file is included to prevent uploading unnecessary files (`.DS_Store`, `.Rprofile`, `renv/`, `.env`, etc.).
