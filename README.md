# INFO 201 - Coursework Repository

This repository contains my homework, in class, assignments, and projects for **INFO 201 (Foundations of Data Science)** at the University of Washington.

## 📂 Structure
Each assignment/problem set has its own folder:

- `PS0/` → Problem Set 0  
- `PS1/` → Problem Set 1  
- `PS2/` → Problem Set 2  
- ...and so on  

Inside each folder you’ll typically find:
- `.Rmd` → R Markdown source file (submission file)  
- `.html` → Knitted output (what the grader checks)  
- `.png` / `.jpeg` → Images used in problem sets (sketches, screenshots, etc.)

---

## ⚙️ Tools
- **R / RStudio** for development  
- **R Markdown** for write-ups and submissions  
- **Git + GitHub** for version control  

---

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Do the assignment in RStudio (`.Rmd` file).  
2. Knit to `.html` / `.pdf` for final output.  
3. Commit and push updates:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "PSX submission"
   git push
   ```
