## **HR Data**

---

### **1.1 Download the the salary data from canvas (files/data/salaries.csv). Load it into R using read_delim().**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

salaries <- read_delim("salaries.csv", delim = ",")
```

---

### **1.2 Did you load it correctly?**

---

#### a) How many rows and columns are there?

```{r} 
dim(salaries)          
nrow(salaries)        
ncol(salaries)   
```

---

#### b) What are the variable names? Do these make sense?

```{r} 
names(salaries)        
colnames(salaries) 
```

---

#### c) Show the first few lines of data.

```{r} 
head(salaries)        
head(salaries, 10)  
```

---

### **1.3 Create a column ’raise’ that stores the size of the raise between 2024 and 2025. (Salary difference between 2024 and 2025).**

```{r}

```
